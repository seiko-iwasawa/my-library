# my-library
This is a library with many things for competitive programming.

## Lib's rules

Formatting: Google

Comments: It is better not to comment code. Comment only if it is neccesary. For example, if you improve code later or if algorithm doesn't work in a well-known way. In the beginning specify used files. 

## Title
