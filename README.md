# my-library
This is a library with many things for competitive programming.

## Lib's rules

Formatting: Google

Comments: It is better not to comment code. Comment only if it is neccesary. For example, if you improve code later or if algorithm doesn't work in a well-known way. In the beginning specify used files. 

## Title

### Basic
Secondary algorithms.
* [Binary Search](/my-library/Basic/Binary%20search.cpp) - search algorithm that finds a target value (lower bound in O(log n) and sqrt(n) in O(log (x / EPS)))
* [Fast Allocator](/my-library/Basic/Fast%20Allocator.cpp) - fast memory allocator that incorrectly frees it
* [Longest Increasing Subsequence](my-library/Basic/Longest%20Increasing%20Subsequence.cpp) - typically dynamic programming (DP) problem

### String
Algorithms with strings.

### Graph
Algorithms with graphs.

### Data Structure
Tricky objects that allow you to do useful things.

### Math
Helpful math and combinatorial algorithms.

### Stresstest
Program to compare solutions.
