# my-library
This is a library with many things for competitive programming.

## Lib's rules

Formatting: Google

Comments: It is better not to comment code. Comment only if it is neccesary. For example, if you improve code later or if algorithm doesn't work in a well-known way.

## Title

### Basic
Secondary algorithms.

### String
Algorithms with strings.

### Graph
Algorithms with graphs.

### Data Structures
Tricky objects that allow you to do useful things.

### Math
Helpful math and combinatorial algorithms.

### Stresstest
Program to compare solutions.
